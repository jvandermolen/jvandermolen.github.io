Today I'm launching my academic website where you can find my CV and this blog. Soon I will add a link to download my PhD Thesis and also a list of publications, which can be also found on my CV.

I will be posting mainly statistics related content, but there will be some non-academic stuff too :)

I also plan to post a step-by-step guide to create a website like this, since it's not as easy as it seems and I would like to share everything I learnt in the process. This is a static website built using [github pages][gh-pages] and [jekyll][jekyll], that is modular in the sense that content and style can be edited separately and so it is very easy to completely change the skin of the website while keeping the content safe. The custom domain is managed through [Amazon's Route 53][route-53] DNS web service. 

That's it for now. See you in the next post!

[gh-pages]:    https://pages.github.com/
[jekyll]:      http://jekyllrb.com
[route-53]:    https://aws.amazon.com/route53/
